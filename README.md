The app was developed in a team of three in a 48-hour hackathon over the Halloween weekend as part of the Diversity in Tech hackathon at [C4Q](http://www.c4q.nyc/) (Coalition for Queens). 

Projects were evaluated by an elite panel of judges including Benjamin Jackson, Director of Mobile at VICE Media, and Tony Barnes, VP of Tech Innovation at Capital One. 

CodeOwl team will present the app at the QTM (Queens Tech MeetUp) in December 2015.
